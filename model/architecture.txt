TracPhi3Config
Purpose: Configuration class that defines all the parameters and settings for the model.
Key Features:

Inherits from Phi3Config (base Phi3 configuration)
Adds multimodal capabilities through MultimodalConfig
Stores all hyperparameters like vision tower settings, projector types, bbox3d module settings
Acts as a blueprint that other classes use to initialize themselves

What it contains:
python# Extracts multimodal-specific parameters like:
- vision_tower, mm_projector_type, bbox3d_module
- mm_hidden_size, image_size, patch_size
- vision_select_layer, proj_layer_type, etc.
TracPhi3Model
Purpose: The core model architecture that handles the actual neural network computations.
Key Features:

Inherits from Phi3Model (base transformer model)
Contains the multimodal components (vision encoder, bbox predictor)
Handles the forward pass computations
Manages multimodal input processing

What it contains:
python- vision_encoder: VisionEncoder          # Processes images
- bbox3d_predictor: BBox3DPredictor     # Predicts 3D bounding boxes  
- multimodal_processor: MultimodalProcessor  # Handles mixed inputs
TracPhi3ForCausalLM
Purpose: The complete model wrapper for causal language modeling tasks (text generation).
Key Features:

Inherits from Phi3ForCausalLM (causal LM wrapper)
Contains a TracPhi3Model instance
Adds the language modeling head (lm_head) for text generation
Implements training logic (forward pass with loss computation)
Implements generation logic (inference/text generation)

What it contains:
python- model: TracPhi3Model              # The core model
- lm_head: nn.Linear               # Output projection for vocabulary
- Forward pass with bbox loss computation
- Generate method for inference
Hierarchy Summary

TracPhi3Model (core computations)

TracPhi3ForCausalLM (complete training/inference interface)
In simple terms:

Config: "What settings should the model use?"
Model: "How does the model process data?"
ForCausalLM: "How do we train and generate text with this model?"

The ForCausalLM class is what you'd typically use for training and inference, while the base Model class focuses purely on the forward computations.
